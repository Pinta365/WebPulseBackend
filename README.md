  views, and unique visitors.
- **Statistics:** View and analyze data per Project or per Realm to gain insights.
- **Self-Hosting:** Host your tracking server for full control over your analytics infrastructure.
- **Public Showcase:** Showcase your data at [webpulseanalytics.com](https://webpulseanalytics.com) using GitHub
